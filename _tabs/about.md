Hi! My name is Roberto Bolgheroni and I'm a Fullstack Software Developer with 5 years of professional experience.

![My photo](https://imgur.com/a/4mz8vrk "Me!")

You can find more about my career and experiences in my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r-bolgheroni/).

Passionate about Software Engineering and inspired by the Agile movement, I'm focused on fast, small development cycles, driven by automated tests and refactoring. 

I'm a fullstack developer - which means I'm competent in any aspect of the development cycle, from gathering requirements/designing, backend/frontend programming, all the way to (basic) setup and deployment of infrastructure over the cloud.

In terms of programming languagues, I'm most proefficient with TypeScript and C#, with which I've worked professionaly with for years, but I've also worked with Java, Python, C, C++, Golang, vanilla JavaScript, among other languages in coursework and personal projects.

I'm a great enthusiast over AI and Intelligent Systems, and I'm interested in developing solutions that wield it! 
Currently, I'm contributing to the [SPIRA project](https://github.com/spirabr), an Intelligent System that uses machine learning models to aid in the diagnosis of respiratory inssuficiency, as my capstone project for my degree. 

Additionaly, I'm a long time gamer =) My favorite games are The Last of Us II, Metal Gear Solid 3, and I actually had a brief stint in collegiate e-sports playing Valorant! (I even got a 1st place medal in one of the tournaments!)
