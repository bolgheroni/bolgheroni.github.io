Hi! My name is Roberto Bolgheroni and I'm a Fullstack Software Developer with 5 years of professional experience.

![My photo](https://i.imgur.com/ykZRxOH.jpg "Me!")

Passionate about Software Engineering and inspired by the Agile movement, I'm focused on fast, small development cycles, driven by automated tests and refactoring. 

As a fullstack developer,  I'm comfortable navigating every stage of the development cycle, from conceptualizing and designing solutions to backend/frontend implementation and even basic infrastructure deployment on the cloud

My primary programming languagues are TypeScript and C#, with which I've worked professionaly with for years, but I've also dabbled with Java, Python, C, C++, Golang, vanilla JavaScript, among other languages, both in coursework and personal projects.

I'm captivated by the possibilities of AI and Intelligent Systems, and I'm interested in developing some soon! 
Currently, I'm contributing to the [SPIRA project](https://github.com/spirabr), an Intelligent System that uses machine learning models to aid in the diagnosis of respiratory inssuficiency, as part of my degree's capstone project. 

Additionaly, I'm a long time gamer =) My favorite games are The Last of Us II, Metal Gear Solid 3, and I actually had a brief stint in collegiate e-sports playing Valorant! (I even got a 1st place medal in one of the tournaments!)
