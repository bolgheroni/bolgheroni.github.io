Included in the course phase I is a contribution to the [Kernel Workflow codebase](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow).

# What is the Kernel Workflow?

As stated on their official docs, kw (as it is commonly reffered to) is a suite of tools aimed at reducing the setup overhead of working with the Linux Kernel. 

It is programmed in bash script and provides tools that support developers in their daily tasks modifying and contributing to the Kernel, from compiling and installing Kernels in VMs to submitting pachtes to the appropriate mailing lists of Kernel maintainers.

# My contribution

Available at the project GitHub Repository is a list of open issues from which we had to choose one to resolve. My pair ([Lucas Quaresma](https://github.com/lucasqml)) and I chose a [simple issue](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/issues/1027) that asked to rename the aforementioned pathc submitting command from `kw mail -s` to `kw send-patch`.

Our [Pull Request](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/1105) is currently open and waiting for review.
