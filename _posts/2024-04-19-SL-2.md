# Troubles in my environment

After finishing the two first tutorials again, I've been frustrated by the same problems: I wasn't able to install new modules at the VM's kernel. 

AFter more debuggin and frustration, I then tried to switch back to [Marcelo's series of tutorials](https://flusp.ime.usp.br/kernel/qemu-libvirt-setup/), but unfortunately, I still wasn't able to execute `libvirt`, due to incompatibilities. 

Instead of spending even more time trying to setup the environment in my machine, I switched to pair programming, and went to collaborate with a colleague that had it all setup nice and smooth. 

# My contribution

Together, we've managed to make a few adjustments to one of the IIO driver files. The changes were simple, but useful, and I describe them next. 

In certain parts of the code, there are loops that iterate trough each children of a node, which have to lock in order to the loop to execute. For each iteration, it is required to free the node after performing the desired computations. In the kernel codebase, there are certain macros which support these iterative operations. 
One of them requires the calling function to do the node freing after each iteration. Another, and actually reccomended one, does it automatically. It's even able to recover from errors within the loop and free the child nodes in those occasions, providing a more robust and resilient approach.
Not all files of the codebase apply the latter, safer macro. Our changes consisted of doing this replacement in a particular file. Additionlay, since the node freeing was made automatically, we could even remove the extra lines of code that would do it in the function call. 

We've posted our changes as a patch through the respective responsible mail list and we are currently waiting for feedback. 

# Note

For clarification, my colleague followed a different series of tutorials than me, which rendered [my personal repo](https://github.com/bolgheroni/free-software-MAC0470) not being useful anymore. I will not be referring to it anymore.
